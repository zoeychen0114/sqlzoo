1.
How many stops are in the database.
*********
select count(*) from stops

2.
Find the id value for the stop 'Craiglockhart'
*********
select id from stops where name = 'Craiglockhart'

3.
Give the id and the name for the stops on the '4' 'LRT' service.
*********
select a.id, a.name
 from stops a
 join route b
 on a.id=b.stop
 where b.num='4' and b.company='LRT'

4.
The query shown gives the number of routes that visit either London Road (149) or Craiglockhart (53). Run the query and notice the two services that link these stops have a count of 2. Add a HAVING clause to restrict the output to these two routes.
*********
select company, num, COUNT(stop)
 from route
 where stop = 149 or stop = 53
 group by company, num
 having count(stop) >= 2
 
 5.
Execute the self join shown and observe that b.stop gives all the places you can get to from Craiglockhart, without changing routes. Change the query so that it shows the services from Craiglockhart to London Road.
*********
select a.company, a.num, a.stop, b.stop
 from route a join route b on a.company=b.company and a.num=b.num
 join stops c on c.id = a.stop
 join stops d on d.id = b.stop
 where c.name = 'Craiglockhart' and d.name = 'London Road'
 
 6.
The query shown is similar to the previous one, however by joining two copies of the stops table we can refer to stops by name rather than by number. Change the query so that the services between 'Craiglockhart' and 'London Road' are shown. If you are tired of these places try 'Fairmilehead' against 'Tollcross'
*********
select a.company, a.num, c.name, d.name
 from route a join route b on a.company=b.company and a.num=b.num
 join stops c on c.id=a.stop
 join stops d on d.id=b.stop
 where c.name = 'Craiglockhart' and d.name = 'London Road'
 
 7.
Give a list of all the services which connect stops 115 and 137 ('Haymarket' and 'Leith')
*********
select a.company, a.num from route a join route b
 on a.company=b.company and a.num=b.num
 where a.stop = 115 and b.stop = 137
 group by a.company, a.num
 
 8.
Give a list of the services which connect the stops 'Craiglockhart' and 'Tollcross'
*********
select a.company, a.num from route a join route b
 on a.company=b.company and a.num=b.num
 join stops c on c.id=a.stop
 join stops d on d.id=b.stop
 where c.name='Craiglockhart' and d.name = 'Tollcross'
 group by a.company, a.num
 
 9.
Give a distinct list of the stops which may be reached from 'Craiglockhart' by taking one bus, including 'Craiglockhart' itself, offered by the LRT company. Include the company and bus no. of the relevant services.
*********
select d.name, a.company, a.num from route a join route b 
 on a.company=b.company and a.num = b.num
 join stops c on c.id=a.stop
 join stops d on d.id=b.stop
 where c.name = 'Craiglockhart' and a.company = 'LRT'
 group by d.name, a.company, a.num


10.
Find the routes involving two buses that can go from Craiglockhart to Lochend.
Show the bus no. and company for the first bus, the name of the stop for the transfer,
and the bus no. and company for the second bus.

Hint
Self-join twice to find buses that visit Craiglockhart and Lochend, then join those on matching stops.
*********
with cte1 as (select a.num, a.company, b.stop from route a
 join route b on a.company=b.company and a.num=b.num
 join stops d on d.id=a.stop
 join stops e on e.id=b.stop
 where d.name = 'Craiglockhart'),
cte2 as (select b.stop, b.num, b.company, e.name from route b
 join route c on b.company=c.company and b.num=c.num
 join stops e on e.id=b.stop
 join stops f on f.id=c.stop
 where f.name = 'Lochend')
select a.num, a.company, b.name, b.num, b.company from cte1 a
 join cte2 b on a.stop=b.stop
