1.
The first example shows the goal scored by a player with the last name 'Bender'. The * says to list all the columns in the table - a shorter way of saying matchid, teamid, player, gtime

Modify it to show the matchid and player name for all goals scored by Germany. To identify German players, check for: teamid = 'GER'
****************
SELECT matchid, player FROM goal 
  WHERE teamid = 'GER'
  
2.
From the previous query you can see that Lars Bender's scored a goal in game 1012. Now we want to know what teams were playing in that match.

Notice in the that the column matchid in the goal table corresponds to the id column in the game table. We can look up information about game 1012 by finding that row in the game table.

Show id, stadium, team1, team2 for just game 1012
****************
SELECT id,stadium,team1,team2
  FROM game
where id = 1012

3.
You can combine the two steps into a single query with a JOIN.

SELECT *
  FROM game JOIN goal ON (id=matchid)
The FROM clause says to merge data from the goal table with that from the game table. The ON says how to figure out which rows in game go with which rows in goal - the matchid from goal must match id from game. (If we wanted to be more clear/specific we could say
ON (game.id=goal.matchid)

The code below shows the player (from the goal) and stadium name (from the game table) for every goal scored.

Modify it to show the player, teamid, stadium and mdate for every German goal.
****************
select player,teamid, stadium, mdate
  from game a right join goal b on (a.id=b.matchid) where teamid = 'GER'
  
4.
Use the same JOIN as in the previous question.

Show the team1, team2 and player for every goal scored by a player called Mario player LIKE 'Mario%'
****************
select a.team1, a.team2, b.player from game a
inner join goal b
on a.id=b.matchid
where b.player like 'Mario%'

5.
The table eteam gives details of every national team including the coach. You can JOIN goal to eteam using the phrase goal JOIN eteam on teamid=id

Show player, teamid, coach, gtime for all goals scored in the first 10 minutes gtime<=10
****************
select a.player, a.teamid, b.coach, a.gtime
from goal a
inner join eteam b
on a.teamid=b.id
where a.gtime<=10

6.
To JOIN game with eteam you could use either
game JOIN eteam ON (team1=eteam.id) or game JOIN eteam ON (team2=eteam.id)

Notice that because id is a column name in both game and eteam you must specify eteam.id instead of just id

List the dates of the matches and the name of the team in which 'Fernando Santos' was the team1 coach.
****************
select a.mdate, b.teamname from game a
inner join eteam b
on a.team1=b.id
where b.coach = 'Fernando Santos'

7.
List the player for every goal scored in a game where the stadium was 'National Stadium, Warsaw'
****************
select b.player from game a
inner join goal b
on b.matchid = a.id
where a.stadium = 'National Stadium, Warsaw'

8.
The example query shows all goals scored in the Germany-Greece quarterfinal.
Instead show the name of all players who scored a goal against Germany.
****************
select distinct b.player from game a join goal b on b.matchid = a.id 
where (a.team1='GER' and b.teamid!='GER') or (a.team2='GER' and b.teamid!='GER')
order by player

9.
Show teamname and the total number of goals scored.
COUNT and GROUP BY
****************
with cte1 as(select b.teamname
from goal a
inner join eteam b
on a.teamid = b.id)
select teamname, count(teamname)
from cte1
group by teamname

10.
Show the stadium and the number of goals scored in each stadium.
****************
with cte1 as
(select matchid, count(matchid) as count_goals from goal group by matchid)
select distinct a.stadium, sum(b.count_goals) from game a
inner join cte1 b
on a.id=b.matchid
group by stadium

11.
For every match involving 'POL', show the matchid, date and the number of goals scored.
****************
with cte1 as (select matchid, count(matchid) as count_goal from goal group by matchid)
select b.matchid, a.mdate, b.count_goal
from game a
inner join cte1 b
on a.id=b.matchid
where a.team1='POL' or a.team2='POL'

12.
For every match where 'GER' scored, show matchid, match date and the number of goals scored by 'GER'
****************
with cte1 as
(select matchid, count(matchid) as count_goal from goal where teamid='GER' group by matchid)
select b.matchid, a.mdate, b.count_goal
from game a
inner join cte1 b
on a.id=b.matchid

13.
List every match with the goals scored by each team as shown. This will use "CASE WHEN" which has not been explained in any previous exercises.
mdate	team1	score1	team2	score2
1 July 2012	ESP	4	ITA	0
10 June 2012	ESP	1	ITA	1
10 June 2012	IRL	1	CRO	3
...
Notice in the query given every goal is listed. If it was a team1 goal then a 1 appears in score1, otherwise there is a 0. You could SUM this column to get a count of the goals scored by team1. Sort your result by mdate, matchid, team1 and team2.
****************
#I think the solution on the website is wrong (sorting is not considered)
select mdate, team1,
sum(case when teamid=team1 then 1 else 0 end) as score1,
team2,
sum(case when teamid=team2 then 1 else 0 end) as score2
from game join goal on matchid = id
group by mdate, team1, team2
#order by mdate, team1, team2
